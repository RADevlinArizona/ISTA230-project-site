						<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
					</header>
					<p>20 Years ago we both graduated here in Tucson from the Eller College of 
						Management, and quickly started our careers in the restaurant industry. 
						After much traveling we found ourselves back in Tucson with a passion for 
						delivering great dining experiences to patrons. With the experience we 
						have gained throughout our careers we decided to finally open a place we 
						could call our own, right here in Tucson. We hope you join us on this 
						journey, and come to call Wildcat Cafe one of your favorite spots in town.
